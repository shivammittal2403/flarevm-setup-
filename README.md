To set up Windows 10 with specific requirements and optimize its performance, follow these steps:

1. **Allocate Sufficient Resources:**
   Ensure your virtual machine meets the requirements, with a minimum of 200GB of storage and adequate RAM.

2. **Disable Windows Update:**
   - Open the Run dialog (win+r) and type `services.msc`.
   - Locate 'Windows Update,' right-click, and choose 'Stop.'
   - Right-click again, go to 'Properties,' set 'Startup type' to 'Disabled,' and click 'Apply' then 'OK.'

3. **Adjust Windows Security Settings:**
   - Open Windows Security and perform a virus and threat protection scan.
   - If issues persist, click on 'Virus & Threat Protection Settings.'
   - Turn off real-time protection, cloud-delivered protection, and other relevant options.

4. **Show Hidden Files:**
   - Open File Explorer, go to 'Documents.'
   - Click on the 'View' tab, then 'Options.'
   - Under the 'View' tab in the Folder Options window, uncheck 'Hide protected operating system files' and click 'Apply' then 'OK.'

5. **Configure Flare VM:**
   - Visit [Flare VM GitHub](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) using Chrome.
   - Download the installation script from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mandiant/flare-vm/main/install.ps1). Save the link as 'install.ps1.'
   - Open PowerShell as an administrator.
   - Navigate to the Downloads folder in PowerShell.
   - Execute the following commands:
     ```powershell
     Unblock-File .\install.ps1
     Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
     Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force
     Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
     .\install.ps1 -password passw0rd!
     ```
   - Allow the script to run; it may take 2-4 hours.

6. **Take a Snapshot in VirtualBox:**
   - Once the Flare VM setup is complete, take a snapshot of the virtual machine in VirtualBox.
   - This snapshot serves as a reference point for future configurations.
